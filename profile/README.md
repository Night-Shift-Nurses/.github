## Story
**Ryuji Hirasaka** - A depraved doctor with severe personality issues. Despite his genius, he has no interest in anything but humiliating and toying with other people, whom he views as nothing more than subjects to use for his experiments.

One day, Hirasaka receives a request to work on a temporary basis at St. Juliana Hospital. Waiting there for him is one of his former victims—**Narumi Jinguji**.

Narumi makes Hirasaka an unexpected proposal. Her goal is to create the world's most corrupt hospital ward, and she wants Hirasaka's help to mold the perfect staff for it.

Hirasaka finds himself perplexed by such an extraordinary proposal. However, the chance to finally realize his twisted ambitions is a temptation he cannot resist. Will St. Juliana Hospital become a den of mad science, or will Hirasaka's incompetence and unlikability spell the end for the Night Shift before it even begins?
